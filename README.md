Based on HTML GL v2

- [Demo](http://pixelscommander.com/polygon/htmlgl/demo/filters.html)
- [Project page](http://html2vr.io)
- [Theory behind HTML GL](http://pixelscommander.com/en/web-applications-performance/render-html-css-in-webgl-to-get-highest-performance-possibl/)

Using HTML2VR you still work with HTML/CSS as you are used to, but DOM elements are just facades to their WebGL represenations. These GPU accelerated textures are very effective from resources consuming perspective and are very cheap to transform or animate.

Rasterization API
-----------------
In order to improve technology we are trying to promote standardized native Rasterization API for JavaScript. Help us to be better and to add this cool feature to browsers by spreading the [article](http://pixelscommander.com/en/javascript/state-of-html-content-rasterization-draw-html-to-canvas-image/) and [proposal draft](https://gist.github.com/PixelsCommander/a0b5882139cbb8a1781c#file-proposal-md).
